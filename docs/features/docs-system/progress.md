# Docs System Progress

- Related Objectives: `OBJ-004`
- Current status: in_progress

## Completed

- `docs/` folder structure created
- Docs hub (`docs/README.md`) created
- `STATUS.md`, `FUTURE_OBJECTIVES.md`, `WORKLOG.md` seeded
- ADR system and initial ADRs created
- Feature, runbook, and template folders created
- Objective-linked session logging fields defined

## Next Improvements

- Add future session entries using templates
- Refine runbooks based on real PHP upgrade/test execution outcomes
- Add more feature workspaces as new initiatives start

## Risk

- Process only helps if maintained consistently after each session
