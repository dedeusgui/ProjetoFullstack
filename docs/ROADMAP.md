# Development Roadmap (Engineering-Facing)

This roadmap complements the product roadmap in `README.md` by focusing on engineering enablement and delivery reliability.

## Near-Term (Current)

- Finalize local environment compatibility (`OBJ-001`)
- Validate and stabilize first-wave automated tests (`OBJ-002`)
- Finish docs system adoption (`OBJ-004`)

## Mid-Term

- Expand automated tests to auth/API/stats (`OBJ-003`)
- Standardize more actions on handler/adaptor pattern (`OBJ-005`)
- Add CI workflow for tests after local stability is confirmed

## Long-Term

- Broader observability and runbooks (`OBJ-006`)
- Stronger release and migration discipline
- Documentation automation/checks (optional)

## Milestone Mapping

- M1: Environment + test execution unblocked
- M2: Testing foundation verified and documented
- M3: Coverage expansion for critical flows
- M4: CI automation and observability improvements
